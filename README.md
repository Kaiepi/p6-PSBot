DESCRIPTION
===========

PSBot is a Pokemon Showdown bot that will specialize in easily allowing the user to customize how the bot responds to messages.

To run PSBot, simply run `bin/psbot`, or in your own code, run the code in the synopsis. Note that `PSBot.start` is blocking.

An example config file has been provided in psbot.json.example. This is to be copied over to `~/.config/psbot.json` and edited to suit your needs. Because of this, PSBot is not compatible with Windows.
